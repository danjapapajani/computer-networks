Almost two years ago to the day I had the one of the most altering yet captivating experiences in my life After about 10 minutes of staring at myself in the mirror - deeply investigating the person I had become - I saw something for the first time - myself üòÆ.

Our body is a bioelectric system and a bioelectric spark initiates every action ‚ö°Ô∏è. From our water and food we are supposed to receive efficient minerals in order to thrive as bioelectric beings. Sadly, due to the industrial revolution and other miscalculated environmental practices we only receive about 5-22 of the necessary 102 minerals or units of bioelectricity ‚öôÔ∏è. Research shows across the board that when minerals go down, dis-ease goes up Imagine how much more you or your plants would reap from water and food if they contained the full matrix of minerals?
